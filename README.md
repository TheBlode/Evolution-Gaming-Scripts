# Evolution-Gaming-Scripts

## Introduction
Welcome to my Evolution Gaming Scripts page! Evolution's autoplay feature is severely lacking in it's functionality for us players so I wrote these scripts to optimize your gaming experience! I hope you enjoy them and they improve your fortunes!

## How to run these scripts
- These scripts run entirely inside your browser's console. Nothing else is required.
- To customise the bot settings, go to "Define your bot settings here!" and edit the values below that line up until "End of bot settings".

- Open up your browser's developer tools (usually F12).
- Make sure you select the iFrame that the game is loaded into;
    - You can right click on the game to discover the game's direct URL and can load the game directly in your browser with no need to select the iFrame.
    - Otherwise, in Chrome, you can select the iFrame by navigating to the Console tab, selecting the "top" dropdown and selecting "KindredGameIframe". 
- Open up the JavaScript file in any text editor, copy **ALL** the text, paste into your browsers console and run the code.
